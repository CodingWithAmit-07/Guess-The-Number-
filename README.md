# Guess-The-Number-
This is my first python game which is the Guess The Number Game. In this game you have to guess a number between 1-100.
<p>If your guess is more than 10 away from my number,the game will tell you you're COLD
<p>If your guess is within 10 of my number,the game will tell you you're WARM
<p>If your guess is farther than your most recent guess,the game will say you're getting COLDER
<p>If your guess is closer than your most recent guess,the game will say you're getting WARMER
